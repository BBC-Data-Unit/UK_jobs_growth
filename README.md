In November 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46288515) one in three new jobs created in the UK over the past decade has been in London.

Employment has been rising across the country but by far the strongest growth has been in the capital, according to official employment statistics.

We analysed official labour market figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for 2007-2017 and found:

- London's job creation rate outstrips its high population growth. Of the 2.7 million new jobs, almost 950,000, or 35%, were created in the capital
- The north-east of England saw the lowest percentage increase in new jobs of any UK region or nation, along with the lowest population increase
- More than half of jobs in London and the South East are now classed as skilled professional occupations
- In the north-east of England and Northern Ireland, the proportion of skilled professional jobs drops to 39% and 36% respectively
